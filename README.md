This is a university-level assignment that I have completed. 

Objectives

• To use records to define immutable data structures.

• To use tuples to return multiple values from methods.

• To practice working with collections (e.g., Lists, Dictionaries, and HashSets) to manage
and organize data.

Description

Families and businesses often need to analyze or plan their monthly cash-flow to find a balance
between incomes and expenses. In this assignment, you will build an application to track
expenses and incomes (revenues) on a monthly basis. The system will help users (individuals
or businesses) understand their financial situation by calculating the difference between
incomes and expenses for each month.
